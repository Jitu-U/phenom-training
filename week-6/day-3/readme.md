 # Unit Testing

Unit testing is testing the very small amount of small functions and expect the results.

Testing the smallest testable unit of code.


 ## Jest

 It is testing framework or library for Js applications.
 
 You can install Jest using package managers into your project as Dev Dependency: 

 `npm install save-dev jest`

 or 

 `yarn add --dev jest `


Add Script in `package.json` file 

` { `

 ` "scripts": { `

 `   "test": "jest" `

  `         } `

`}`

Now you can create `fileName.test.js` to write tests for function in filename.js file.

Example in [here](./jest.js)
