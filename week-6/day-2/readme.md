# Introduction to TypeScript

Js is loosely typed language, 
 typescript offers all there is from Javascript in addition to Typescript types.

 e.g. there are types in Js like String and Numbers but there is no consistency, like you can reassign the value of a variable which was number to a string. And that causes problems in complex programs.
- We can declare types with every variable, On declaration or when passing to functions.

`let a: number = 1`
 - We can declare types using `interface` declaration.

 [example](./TypeScript.ts)

-  You can also decalre types in classes
- You can also specify types for return value of a function , example [here](./TypeScript.ts)
